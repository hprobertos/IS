# Welcome to HBConect page!

This was a project made in 2 months by a team of 4 members where we acted as a SCRUM Team.

There was a Scrum Master, a Product Owner and 2 developers.

Every template used here has a free license for school purposes.
Feel free to use the project in anyway, although it's pretty much useless, but you can recycle styles and layouts.
